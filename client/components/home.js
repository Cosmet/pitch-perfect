        <h2>What's a Pitch?</h2>
        <p>
          A pitch (a.k.a: elevator pitch) is a short, persuasive speech that you use to tell someone about yourself, your product, idea or your organization.
          <br />
          <br />

          A good pitch sparks interest in the person you're pitching to and should last no longer than a short elevator ride around 60 seconds. You can have a longer pitch, but keep it under 2-3 minutes. They should be interesting and memorable. They also need to explain what makes you, or what you're pitching â€“ unique.
        </p>
        <h3>When do you use it?</h3>
        <p>
          Anytime you're meeting new people. Usually at conferences, networking events, seminars, and elevators. You get the idea. Tailor your pitch to the occassion for the best results.

        <h3>What were you doing in the past?</h3>
        <p>
          This should be brief and sum up your most relevant past. It should also lead you into the next question.
        </p>
        <h3>How did you get to where you are today?</h3>
        <p>
          This is where you would put your "wow" factor or "ah-ha" moment to how you got to where you are today. If you don't have one that's fine.
        </p>
        <h3>What are you looking for now in this career path?</h3>
        <p>
          This is where you can show your passion for your new career.
